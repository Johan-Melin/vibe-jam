Reach the end of the track before the music ends
Collect "rhythm points" by hitting collectibles in time with the beat
Avoid obstacles to preserve health
Challenges:
Difficulty increases with more frequent obstacles and complex patterns
Later levels introduce new mechanics, such as temporary invincibility or speed boosts tied to the music
The gameplay focuses on timing and reflexes, blending driving mechanics with rhythm-based challenges, similar to Neon Drive, while adding a unique vaporwave twist.
