Title: Zombie Road Smash (or any name you prefer)

Genre: Arcade-style vehicular destruction, open-world zombie survival

Core Concept:
A fast-paced, physics-driven demolition game where you drive through a blocky, procedurally generated city overrun by zombies. Your goal is to destroy buildings, flatten hordes of zombies, and survive against increasingly chaotic waves of undead while upgrading your truck with ridiculous modifications.

Key Features:

Physics-based destruction – Drive through buildings and watch them collapse realistically.

Zombie hordes – Massive groups of blocky undead swarm the city, getting in your way (and under your wheels).

Upgradable vehicle – Attach wrecking balls, spikes, flamethrowers, or even a cowcatcher-style ram to maximize destruction.

Combo system – Chain together zombie kills and structural collapses for higher scores and rewards.

Dynamic environment – Randomized city layouts ensure no two runs are the same.

Survival mechanics – Limited fuel, repair stations, and escalating zombie threats force players to balance destruction and strategy.

Game Modes:

Endless Rampage – Survive as long as possible against growing waves of zombies while causing as much destruction as you can.

Mission-Based Chaos – Specific objectives like "Flatten X zombies in 60 seconds" or "Destroy 10 buildings before sunrise."

Destruction Derby – Compete against AI-driven demolition trucks in a last-vehicle-standing battle.

Visual Style:

Voxel-based graphics similar to Minecraft, with exaggerated ragdoll physics for zombies and debris.

Retro pixel explosions and blood splatters for over-the-top arcade-style fun.

Inspirations:

Carmageddon – For vehicular zombie mayhem.

Teardown – For physics-based destruction.

Minecraft-style aesthetics – To make the destruction visually unique and fun.
