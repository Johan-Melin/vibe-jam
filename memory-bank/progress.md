# Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Project Environment Setup - Completed
- Created a Node.js project for "Zombie Road Smash"
- Installed Three.js as the main rendering framework
- Created index.html with a canvas element and basic styling
- Created main.js that imports Three.js and sets up:
  - A basic scene
  - A perspective camera
  - A WebGL renderer
  - A test cube to verify rendering
  - A window resize handler
  - An animation loop
- Set up a development server using the 'serve' package
- Fixed module import path for Three.js to work in browser

## Step 2: Project Rules Configuration - Completed
- Created .cursor/rules directory
- Added threejs-rules.md with:
  - Semantic description for Three.js game development
  - File pattern to apply to all JavaScript files
  - Detailed guidance on Three.js best practices
  - Specific rules for performance, structure, and memory management

## Step 3: Basic 3D Scene - Completed
- Enhanced the scene with proper lighting:
  - Added ambient light for base illumination
  - Added directional light with shadows
- Improved the renderer with:
  - Pixel ratio optimization
  - Shadow mapping enabled
- Created a ground plane:
  - Used PlaneGeometry for the ground
  - Applied MeshStandardMaterial with realistic properties
  - Configured to receive shadows
- Enhanced the test cube:
  - Changed to MeshStandardMaterial with physically-based properties
  - Enabled shadow casting and receiving
  - Positioned to sit on the ground
- Added orbit controls:
  - Imported OrbitControls from Three.js examples
  - Configured with smooth damping
  - Limited polar angle to prevent going below ground
